# PassSHAfe

PassSHAfe is a deterministic HMAC-SHA-256 based password safe. It does not store a password database anywhere and you 
only have to remember one master password. To access a password for a specific account you need a unique account 
identifier. It is very important that you choose unique identifiers for all your accounts and that you can remember 
the identifier. For example you could always use "\<URL\>:\<username\>" as your account identifier. For your master 
password you should choose a really strong password. If you think you cannot remember your master password then write 
it down and put it somewhere safe because if you forget your master password it is impossible to access any of your 
account passwords. So make sure to choose a secure password and keep it somewhere safe.
